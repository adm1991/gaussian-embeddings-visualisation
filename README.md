# gaussian-embeddings-visualisation
Final master's thesis project. Code included in this repository was used to visualise changes in the meanings of words encoded as
probabilistic Gaussian embeddings using the Word2GM architecture of Athiwaratkun and Wilson (2017) across time. input is assumed
to be either unimodal, or bimodal embeddings generated using this method. Output takes the form of graphs showing changes in the
Jensen-Shannon divergence, and cosine similarity between the embeddings of words across time, as well as the log determinant for
a target word, visualising broadening of it's meaning across time.
